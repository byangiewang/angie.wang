Brookfield Place in Battery Park houses luxury retailers, high-end restaurants, corporate offices and an indoor farm. In April 2016, founder and CEO Rob Laing combined his software background and interest in plant-based foods to launch Farm.One, a hydroponic farm that grows rare herbs from around the world in the heart of downtown Manhattan. Last fall, the startup opened its second location in Tribeca.
